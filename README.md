# ReefCalculator
*** Available on the iOS App Store ***
I built Reef Calculator to determine how much of an elemnt to dose in my reef tank. Corals require a certain Calcium, Alkalinity, and Magnesium levels in order to thrive.
However, each product on the market has a different dossage, and often times it can be confusing.

For this app I added all major products on the market, I created the calculations using the ratio of each product, and wrote a simple algorithm to calculate how much of each product is needed.

The next feature for this app is a To Do list which will be launched mid october.
