## Why did I make this?
Reef tanks are complicated, corals consume Alkalinity, Calcium and Magnesium daily, and in order to keep them alive, you must dose these three elements based on the consumption. 

I built this app so that a user can input the water volume, current level and their target level, then the app will calculate how much to dose based on the criteria. 

There are many products in the app each with different dosing, so the challenge was to determine the ratio of each product to come up with accurate results.
